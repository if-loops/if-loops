### [Hi there!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schoepfstefan/)

I'm pursuing a PhD at the University of Cambridge focusing on [machine unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07707) and [cooperative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04785) in industry settings. I previously worked in the Tech & Digital Advantage team of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in ZÃ¼rich and co-founded a deep tech startup funded by the European Space Agency Business Incubator ([ESA BIC](https://commercialisation.esa.int/startups/audili-og/)).
You can find my recent publications/preprints and work experience on my [website](https://if-loops.github.io/) or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AMpAcmSaKaW0snOIpdKgQrC5kmuZJq7s2PKQi-A3BCJrSnTSLFb7QjmonS9IP91m64vXgXfBFcc0-MKYV78R3_jmTrb-&user=GTvLmf0AAAAJ&inst=6810896796868835251).


Some cool things I have built in the past:

- RL for the two NP-hard problems of [container packing and vehicle routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12136)
- Remote soil type prediction with spectral satellite data (ESA BIC, [Copernicus Masters winner](https://copernicus-masters.com/winner/audili-remote-soil-analysis/))
